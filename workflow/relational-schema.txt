Schema:

step 1:
customer_credentials -> (id*,name,email,password,address,age)
room -> (id*, status)
hotels -> (id*, name, address, filename)
services -> (id*, name, filename)
food -> (id*, name, type, rate, filename)
bills -> (id*, date, total_amount)
roomtype -> (id*, ac, capacity, rate)

step 2: 1:N relationship mapping

room -> (id*, status, roomtypeid(fk), hotelid(fk), roomno)

step 3: M:N relationship mapping

booking -> (id*, roomid(id from room as fk), cusid(id from customer_credentials as fk),
	    cindate, coutdate, noOfguests, ratefactor, bookingstatus)

Hotelservices -> (idhotel(id from hotels as fk)*, idservice(id from services as fk)*,
		rate, description, capacity, status)

Hotelfood -> (hotelid(id from hotels as fk)*, foodid(id from food as fk)*,
	   	description, status)

CustomerServices -> (cusid(fk)*, serviceid(fk)*, usedate*)

CustomerFood -> (cusid(fk)*, foodid(fk)*, orderdate*, quantity)

CustomerBill -> (cusid(fk)*, billid(fk)*)

step 3: Multivalued Attribute

guests -> (name*, bookingid(id from booking as fk)*)
